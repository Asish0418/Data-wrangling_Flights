##Flights##
An Entry into tidyverse package, complete implementation of "Dplyr" package.
Flights dataset can be called inside the R world itself through the nycflights13 package itself, which we have done here.
We have covered all the fucntionalities of the dplyr package one by one :
    a)Flights commit has the code and little bit of explanations of functions for all the types.
    b)Assignment files has the snaps of the outputs in a sequence.
        i)Assignment 2 contains the filter function. (It's used to get the subset dataset from a dataframe.)
       ii)Assignment 3 contains the arrange function. (It's used to arrange the row wise values of the columns of the dataset.)
      iii)Assignment 4 contains the select function. (It's similar to filter function but here the subset contatins only the  columns we want to select from the dataset).
       iv)Assignment 5 contains the mutate function. (It's used to add new columns to a dataset.)
        v)Assignment 6 contains the summarise function by grouping them according to our need.
